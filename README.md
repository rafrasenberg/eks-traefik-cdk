# AWS EKS with Traefik v2 and the AWS CDK

This is the repository for a guest blog post I have written for Traefik. For an in-depth walk-through, [check out the post here.](https://traefik.io/blog/aws-elastic-kubernetes-traefik/)

## Deployment
To deploy, change the constants in `ops/lib/constants.ts` with the appropriate values and then run:

```sh
cdk deploy
```
